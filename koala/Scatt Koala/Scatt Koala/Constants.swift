let SIGHT_KOALA = "SIGHT A KOALA IN A TREE.                                         Koalas don't usually stay in the same tree for more than a day. Collecting fresh scats from beneath a koala occupied tree will increase the chance of isolating good gualitv DNA. Scats should onlv be collected if they have not been exposed to rain."

let FRESH_SCAT = "LOOK FOR A FRESH SCAT BENEATH THE KOALA.                           Fresh scats have a shiny coating, a strong Eucalypt odour and may appear moist. Old scats that are unusable lack shine, are dull in colour and may have a cracked surface."

let THIRD = "USE A TOOK TO PICK UP THE SCAT                                       Without touching the scat, carefully insert a double ended toothpick into the scat to pick it up. This will avoid contaminating the sample with the collector's skin cells and DNA."

let FOURTH = "INSERT THE TOOTHPICK/SCAT INTO THE FOAM BLOCK                              Collecting scats in this way prevents the loss of scat surface cells by contact     with collection containers."

let FIFTH = "RECORD SAMPLE DETAILS ON THE BOX                                         If possible, record the GPS location (UTM or Lat/Long degrees) of the sampling site. GPS coordinates could be obtained using a smartphone e.g. 'Compass' on iPhone). Otherwise, you could provide a location description"
